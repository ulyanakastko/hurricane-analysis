I wrote several functions that organise and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions uses several parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements:

	•	A function that constructs a dictionary made out of the lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are the dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data about the hurricane;
 
	•	A function that constructs a dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year;
 
	•	A function that counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane;
 
	•	A function that finds the area affected by the most hurricanes and how often it was hit;
 
	•	A function that finds the hurricane that caused the most significant number of deaths and how many deaths it caused;
 
	•	A function that rates hurricanes on a mortality scale, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of deaths for that rating.
